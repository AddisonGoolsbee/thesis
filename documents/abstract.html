<h1>Reoxidizer: Idiomizing Rust Code Using Recursive LLMs</h1>
<h3>Addison Goolsbee </h3>
<h3>Advised by Lin Zhong</h3>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p> Can a large language model agent autonomously refactor real-world Rust into the fully idiomatic, unsafe-free style
    that
    make the most out of the language's advantages? To probe that question we built Reoxidizer, an open-source CLI that
    loops through (i) strategy generation, (ii) code patch generation via recursive prompting, and (iii) automated
    evaluation with compile, test, and idiomatic evaluation steps. The agent targets five design goals—effectiveness,
    efficiency, adaptability, security, and transparency—and encodes them in version-controlled prompts plus a
    patch-then-apply workflow that cuts inference cost to 10-20 s per iteration. We benchmark Reoxidizer on three
    progressively harder programs: a 60-line Quicksort (C2Rust), the 1.5 k-line RobotFindsKitten game (C2Rust), and a
    modified version of the 700-line Theseus OS e1000 driver. In 15 seconds, the agent removed all 24 unsafe lines from
    Quicksort; under the same 15-minute budget it trimmed four unsafe lines from RobotFindsKitten and produced no
    compiling
    patch for e1000. The study therefore delineates the frontier of current LLM coding agents—effective on localized
    refactors, brittle on cross-cutting redesigns—and releases an extensible architecture for future research.
